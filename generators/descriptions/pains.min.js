One hand reached for the stability of a wall while the other clasped their chest in agony","A dull pulsing pain crept up their leg, increasing in intensity every second. Ten seconds passed, and then another ten. The pain would soon become unbearable","Suddenly the pain from their wound flared up with an intensity unlike ever before.

Perhaps if they could shift their focus away from the pain it'd be easier to manage","The road ahead was a tough one and right now they weren't sure whether they were willing to walk it, let alone whether they were able","It was all too much to handle and for a moment they considered giving in to the pain and giving up","With the passing of each moment the pain only seemed to get worse and worse. For a moment they feared it would never stop","Ten seconds passed, then twenty, then thirty, the pain never subsided.

Tired and frustrated they wanted it all to be over and done with","They squeezed their eyes shut tight and their face turned to a grimace.

They were unable to block out the pain entirely","They tried their hardest to ignore the pain and focus on both continuing with what they're doing while still allowing the injuries to heal","They were exhausted and unable to focus. While it would potentially be possible to block out the pain, there was no way to block out the exhaustion","They were tired. Tired both because of the pain and tired of having to deal with the pain, but they didn't really have a choice in the matter"],a=["But there was no way they could give in to the pain, there was no way they'd ever give up. They pressed forward, every movement adding to the barrage if pain, but they kept going no matter what",'Maybe giving up was the right choice, "always listen to your body" they always said. Their legs gave out from under him and they dropped to the floor. Perhaps they were right',"Perhaps against their better judgment they swallowed the pain and continued onward, but taking at least some care to prevent making it worse","But after a few more moments of pure focus they managed to block out the pain enough to make it nothing more than a minor annoyance. It'll last a while, but they'll manage","But they managed to block out some of the pain by keeping their mind occupied with other tasks. It wasn't ideal, but by the time they're done the pain will hopefully have subsided again","But unwilling to keep fighting they hopped in bed and were ready to sleep, a good rest would surely get rid of the pain. Now if only they were able to fall asleep","They told themselves it'd be over soon, whether that was true or not was irrelevant as it gave them the necessary strength to deal with it nonetheless","But unable to cope with it they gave up and headed to bed. A good night's, or in this case a day and night's rest would surely help","But they were no longer able or perhaps simply unwilling to deal with the pain today. Ready to block out both the pain and the world they closed the curtains and hopped into bed","However, determined not to let the pain ruin this day they struggled onward. Perhaps not the best solution, but they had made up their mind","But it was all too much for today. It was clear nothing could be done and nothing would get done. They might as well spend the rest of the day relaxing the best they can","On any other day they probably would've gone to bed and rested to make sure they'd heal well and fast, but not today. Today was a day of pushing the limits","But they felt sore all over, the injury was clearly taking its toll on their entire body. But they refused to let this day go to waste, so they pressed onward","However, there wasn't much they could do. Sure, painkillers would help a little, but they didn't like taking them.

Eventually they gave in and headed to bed, tomorrow would surely be a better day","But it was clear to them that this was going to be a long day, but they were absolutely determined to not let this pain make this day an unfruitful one, so they pressed onward","For now the pain was manageable. Annoying, but manageable. They swallowed the pain and continued onward with their day, longing for the night and the bed that waited for them","They longed for their bed, a hot bath or just a fluffy pillow to lie on, but right now that wasn't an option to them.
